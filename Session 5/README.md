# Session 5 - ERA Phase I - Assignment 

## Goals 
The goal of this assignment is to create a modular structure for our code. By separating different components into different files the code becomes cleaner, more readable making it easier to debug. 

## Usage 
1. model.py contains the model class Net(). 
2. utils.py contains various functions for visualization, information on devices etc. 
3. S5.ipynb is the notebook that uses model.py and utils.py files for training on MNIST dataset for image classification.
